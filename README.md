**Example of oracle in action, running two simulatious simulations**

## NAQ (nobody asked questions)

1. How long did this take you to make :: About 2-3 hours in one day, but I don't know too much about C.
2. Why did you make this :: I was bored.
3. Do you plan to have others contribute :: Who would want to help this? TBH this sucks, but I like it. So sure, if people really want to.

## How to compile (Linux)
I really only developed and planned for this to be run on linux.

### 1. Download the source code. (Either git clone or donwload file)

**In this image I'm downloading the .zip file**

### 2. Extract & open files via terminal

### 3. Compile using GCC (install if not already installed)

### 4. Run it!

**Since the code is FOSS, you can update and tinker whatever you want with it (just be sure if you plan to publish at least say where you got it from)**


## Windows install coming soon
