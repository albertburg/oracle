## NAQ (nobody asked questions)

1. How long did this take you to make :: About 2-3 hours in one day, but I don't know too much about C.
2. Why did you make this :: I was bored.
3. Do you plan to have others contribute :: Who would want to help this? TBH this sucks, but I like it. So sure, if people really want to.
